## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
- Users with visual impairment may have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors in the user interface, so the addition of a colorblind-friendly theme would help. 
- Users with physical disabilities may have difficulty drawing or selecting with the mouse. For these users, the addition of alternative input options such as touch-based interfaces or support for drawing tablets would help. Also, many components of the user interface can be made larger to make selection and use easier.

### 2. Flexibility in Use


### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- #### Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
  - The drawing screen is fairly straightforward with the function of each tool or button very clear.
  - An improvement would be to move the color selection and generation functionalities into a toolbar on the side of the drawing canvas instead of in a separate menu. This would make the user interface more streamlined so the user does not have to navigate through so many menus.
- #### Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
  - The tools and components in the user interface are intuitive and it is easy to tell what each button or option does based on the text displayed.
- #### For the accommodation of a wide range of literacy and language skills:
  - We could add support for different languages in the user interface. 
  - Alternatively, we could also replace a lot of the text in our app with visual icons (for example, the "Paint" or "Erase" buttons can have icons representing a pen and an eraser instead of the literal text). 
- #### Arrangement of information and its consistency with importance
  - The basic drawing tools are organized together in the toolbar at the top of the app, while to other functions such as saving and rendering are on a separate toolbar at the bottom.
  - To improve in this area, we could separate the color palettes so that they are displayed either with the other drawing tools or in another separate toolbar (since they are not as related to the saving and rendering functionalities).
- #### For prompting and feedback during and after task completion
  - We display error messages to tell the user what to do. For example, when the user enters the description of their sketch and choose to render, they will be told if the description is not valid (if it is empty or too long).
  - A feature to add would be to make it more obvious what the currently selected color is. The user can currently select and paint with different colors, but it is not obvious what the current color is.
  - Another feature to add would be to display tooltips that provide more information about different actions. We currently only display error messages when issues occur as well as simple prompts to guide the user.
